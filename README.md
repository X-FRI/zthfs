## Configuration Management

### Configuration File Structure

ZTHFS uses JSON configuration files, supporting hot reloading:

```json
{
  "data_dir": "/var/lib/zthfs/data",
  "mount_point": "/mnt/medical",
  "encryption": {
    "key": "hex-encoded-32-byte-key-here",
    "nonce_seed": "hex-encoded-12-byte-seed"
  },
  "logging": {
    "enabled": true,
    "file_path": "/var/log/zthfs/access.log",
    "level": "info",
    "max_size": 1048576,
    "rotation_count": 5
  },
  "integrity": {
    "enabled": true,
    "algorithm": "blake3",
    "xattr_namespace": "zthfs.checksum",
    "key": "32-byte-hex-encoded-integrity-key-here"
  },
  "performance": {
    "max_concurrent_operations": 100,
    "cache_size": 1000,
    "chunk_size": 4194304
  },
  "security": {
    "allowed_users": [1000],
    "allowed_groups": [1000],
    "max_failed_attempts": 5,
    "lockout_duration": 300
  }
}
```

### Configuration Validation

```bash
# Validate configuration file
zthfs validate --config /etc/zthfs/config.json

# Generate default configuration
zthfs init --config /etc/zthfs/config.json
```

### Chunking Configuration

ZTHFS supports configurable file chunking to optimize performance for different workloads:

```json
{
  "performance": {
    "chunk_size": 4194304,    // 4MB (default), set to 0 to disable chunking
    "max_concurrent_operations": 100,
    "cache_size": 1000
  }
}
```

Chunk Size Options:
- `0`: Disable chunking entirely (all files stored as single files)
- `1024*1024` (1MB): Smaller chunks, better for random access
- `4*1024*1024` (4MB): Default balance between memory usage and performance
- `16*1024*1024` (16MB): Larger chunks, better for sequential access

When to Adjust Chunk Size:
- Small chunks (< 2MB): Better for systems with frequent random access patterns
- Large chunks (‚â• 8MB): Better for streaming workloads and memory-constrained environments
- Disable chunking (0): For workloads where all files are small or performance is critical

### Environment Variable Configuration

```bash
export ZTHFS_DATA_DIR=/data/zthfs
export ZTHFS_MOUNT_POINT=/mnt/medical
export ZTHFS_LOG_LEVEL=debug
zthfs mount
```

- Async Processing: Lock-free logging with dedicated worker threads
- Compiler Optimizations: LTO enabled, single codegen unit, panic=abort, CPU-specific optimizations
- Dependencies: tokio (1.0), crossbeam-channel (0.5), blake3 (1.8.2), criterion (0.7.0)

### Performance Optimization Insights

#### Chunking Strategy Benefits:
- Memory Efficiency: Large files (>4MB) use 75% less peak memory through chunked processing
- Metadata Advantage: Chunked files provide ~50% faster size queries via metadata lookup
- Scalability: Supports files of any size without memory constraints
- Optimized I/O: Only affected chunks are read/written during partial operations

#### Performance Trade-offs:
- Security Enhancement: BLAKE3 nonce generation provides cryptographic security (48% encryption overhead acceptable)
- Async Logging: Channel-based architecture eliminates lock contention in high-concurrency scenarios
- Partial Writes: Dramatically improved - now only processes affected chunks instead of entire files
- Cross-chunk Operations: ~2x slower for operations spanning chunk boundaries (acceptable trade-off)
- Permission Checks: Fine-grained access control with minimal latency impact
- Compiler Optimizations: LTO and CPU-specific instructions maximize performance within security constraints

#### Recommended Usage Patterns:
- Small Files (<4MB): Use regular files - extremely fast partial writes (~19Œºs)
- Large Files (‚â•4MB): Use chunked files - efficient partial operations, memory-conscious
- Random Access: Regular files excel at frequent small writes
- Sequential Access: Chunked files optimal for large file processing
- Medical Imaging: Chunked files ideal for large DICOM files with partial updates
- Concurrent Access: Excellent performance under multi-user medical workflows
- High-frequency Partial Writes: Consider file size when choosing chunking strategy

### Chunking Performance Trade-offs Analysis

#### 1. When Should Chunking Be Enabled?

Enable chunking when you have:
- Large file workloads: Systems processing files >4MB (DICOM images, large datasets)
- Memory-constrained environments: Edge devices, embedded systems, or limited RAM
- Sequential access patterns: Applications that read entire files or large contiguous blocks
- Scalability requirements: Systems handling files of unpredictable or very large sizes

Avoid chunking when you have:
- Small file dominance: Most files <1MB with frequent random access
- Real-time requirements: Applications needing sub-millisecond response times
- Predictable file sizes: Workloads where most files fall near the chunking threshold (3-5MB)
- High random access frequency: Systems requiring frequent small reads from large files

#### 2. How to Choose Chunk Size?

Chunk Size Selection Guidelines:

| Chunk Size    | Use Case                                 | Performance Characteristics                           |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1MB           | High random access, real-time systems    | Lower memory usage, more frequent I/O operations      |
| 4MB (Default) | Balanced workloads, general medical data | Optimal balance of memory efficiency and access speed |
| 8-16MB        | Sequential access, streaming workloads   | Maximum memory efficiency, fewer I/O operations       |
| 0 (Disabled)  | Small files only, maximum performance    | No chunking overhead, direct file access              |

Selection Criteria:
- Smaller chunks (1-2MB): Choose when random access is frequent and memory is not a bottleneck
- Medium chunks (4MB): Default choice for mixed workloads and general medical applications
- Larger chunks (8-16MB): Choose when memory efficiency is critical and sequential access dominates
- Disabled (0): Choose only when all files are small and performance is paramount

#### 3. Performance Impact of Chunking

Performance Trade-offs:

| Operation Type         | Small Files (<4MB)        | Large Files (‚â•4MB)    | Impact                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Memory Usage           | Standard                  | 75% reduction         | ‚úÖ Significant benefit  |
| Sequential Read        | Good                      | Excellent             | ‚úÖ Major improvement    |
| Random Access          | Excellent (~19Œºs)         | Good (~4.4ms)         | ‚úÖ Balanced performance |
| Partial Read           | Fast (~19Œºs)              | Varies (956Œºs-9.6ms)  | ‚úÖ Optimized chunking   |
| Partial Write          | Excellent (~19Œºs)         | Varies (1.9ms-18ms)   | ‚úÖ Major improvement    |
| Cross-chunk Operations | N/A (not chunked)         | ~2x slower            | ‚ö†Ô∏è Acceptable trade-off |
| File Size Query        | Slower (decrypt required) | 49% faster (metadata) | ‚úÖ Net benefit          |
| Full Write Operations  | Standard                  | Slight overhead       | ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor impact         |

## Performance Tuning

### Benchmark Configuration

ZTHFS v2.0 uses advanced compiler profiles optimized for high-concurrency and large file operations:

```toml
[profile.release]
opt-level = 3        # enable highest level of optimization
lto = true           # enable link time optimization
codegen-units = 1    # use single code generation unit, for better optimization
panic = "abort"      # abort on panic, reduce binary size
strip = true         # remove debug symbols, further reduce binary size
debug = true         # keep debug information for production environment troubleshooting

[profile.bench]
inherits = "release" # inherit release configuration
debug = false        # remove debug information to get accurate benchmark results

```

#### Configuration Options Explained

| Option                 | Purpose                                         | Impact on Performance              |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |

| `debug = false`        | Removes debug symbols and metadata              | +2-5% reduced binary size          |
| `lto = true`           | Link-time optimization across crate boundaries  | +5-10% better code generation      |
| `codegen-units = 1`    | Single compilation unit for better optimization | +3-8% improved instruction cache   |
| `panic = "abort"`      | Minimal panic runtime overhead                  | +1-2% faster error paths           |
| `strip = true`         | Removes all debug symbols                       | +1-3% reduced binary size          |
| `inherits = "release"` | Inherit release profile settings                | Consistent optimization levels     |
| RUSTFLAGS              | Environment variable for CPU-specific opts      | +5-10% architecture-specific gains |

### Performance Tuning Recommendations

#### For High-Throughput Medical Systems:
```bash
# Enable maximum concurrency
export ZTHFS_MAX_CONCURRENT_OPS=1000

# Optimize for large files with efficient partial writes
export ZTHFS_CHUNK_SIZE_MB=4

# Use native CPU optimizations for cryptographic operations
export RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"
cargo build --release
```

#### For High-Frequency Partial Write Workloads:
```bash
# For small files with frequent partial writes (< 4MB)
export ZTHFS_CHUNK_SIZE_MB=0  # Disable chunking for maximum speed

# For large files with occasional partial writes (‚â• 4MB)
export ZTHFS_CHUNK_SIZE_MB=8  # Larger chunks reduce cross-boundary overhead
```

#### For Memory-Constrained Environments:
```bash
# Reduce chunk size for smaller memory footprint
export ZTHFS_CHUNK_SIZE_MB=1

# Optimize cache sizes
export ZTHFS_CACHE_SIZE=500
```

#### Benchmarking Best Practices:
```bash
# Use optimized profile for accurate measurements
cargo bench --profile bench

# Test with realistic workloads
cargo bench -- --test-threads=4 --warm-up-time=3s
```

#### Performance Testing Commands

```bash
# Set CPU optimizations for benchmarks
export RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"

# Run all benchmarks with optimized profile
cargo bench

# Run specific benchmark suites
cargo bench --bench crypto_benchmarks      # Encryption performance
cargo bench --bench integrity_benchmarks  # Integrity verification
cargo bench --bench filesystem_benchmarks # Filesystem operations

# Run specific filesystem operation benchmarks
cargo bench --bench filesystem_benchmarks partial_reads      # Partial read performance
cargo bench --bench filesystem_benchmarks partial_writes     # Partial write performance
cargo bench --bench filesystem_benchmarks chunking_comparison # Chunking vs non-chunking

# Compare performance with different configurations
cargo bench -- --baseline main
```



#### Benchmark Environment Recommendations

For accurate and reproducible benchmarks:

1. Hardware: Use consistent hardware with AES-NI support
2. System Load: Run benchmarks on idle systems
3. Memory: Ensure sufficient RAM (minimum 8GB)
4. Background Processes: Stop unnecessary services
5. Power Management: Set CPU governor to "performance"

#### Performance Monitoring in Production

```bash
# Enable detailed performance logging
export ZTHFS_LOG_LEVEL=debug
export ZTHFS_PERFORMANCE_MONITORING=true

# Monitor system resources
htop -p $(pgrep zthfs)

# Analyze performance metrics
zthfs health --metrics --verbose
```

### Benchmark Accuracy Notes

- Baseline Measurements: All benchmarks use statistical analysis with 95% confidence intervals
- Outlier Detection: Criterion.rs automatically detects and handles measurement outliers
- Warm-up Period: Each benchmark includes a 3-second warm-up phase
- Sample Size: 100 samples per benchmark for statistical reliability
- CPU Frequency Impact: Performance results are sensitive to CPU frequency scaling - higher frequencies yield better results
- Hardware Acceleration: AES-NI and CRC32c hardware acceleration significantly improve cryptographic operations

### CPU Frequency Impact Analysis

The benchmark results show significant performance improvements with optimized compiler settings and CPU-specific optimizations:

| Component        | Metric                | Performance Improvement |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Encryption       | 1KB AES-256-GCM       | -32.5% latency          |
| Encryption       | 1MB AES-256-GCM       | -30.2% latency          |
| File I/O         | 1KB operations        | -8.0% latency           |
| File I/O         | 1MB operations        | -20.9% latency          |
| Chunking         | 8MB file operations   | -41.4% latency          |
| Nonce Generation | Per-file unique nonce | +3.8% latency           |

Recommendation: For optimal performance in production environments:
- Use `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"` during compilation
- Set CPU frequency scaling to "performance" mode
- Disable power saving features for maximum throughput
- Enable Link-Time Optimization (LTO) for cross-crate optimizations

```

## Development Guide

### Development Environment Setup

```bash
# Install development dependencies
sudo apt-get install -y fuse libfuse-dev pkg-config

# Install Rust development tools
cargo install cargo-watch cargo-audit cargo-bench

# Run in development mode
cargo watch -x test -x 'clippy -- -D warnings'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Service Won't Start

```bash
# Check systemd service status
sudo systemctl status zthfs
journalctl -u zthfs -n 50

# Common issues:
# - FUSE not available: Check if fuse kernel module is loaded
lsmod | grep fuse

# - Permission denied: Ensure user has FUSE permissions
sudo usermod -a -G fuse zthfs

# - Configuration error: Validate config before starting
sudo zthfs validate --config /etc/zthfs/config.json

# - Port conflict (if applicable): Check if mount point is already in use
mount | grep /mnt/zthfs
```

#### 2. Mounting Failure

```bash
# Check FUSE permissions
sudo usermod -a -G fuse $USER

# Check kernel module
lsmod | grep fuse

# Restart FUSE service
sudo systemctl restart fuse
```

#### 2. Permission Issues

```bash
# Check user permissions
id $USER

# Fix file permissions
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /data/zthfs

# Check mount point permissions
ls -ld /mnt/medical
```

#### 5. systemd Namespace Errors (Error code 226/NAMESPACE)

If you see "226/NAMESPACE" error in systemd logs:

```bash
# Check systemd service status
sudo systemctl status zthfs
journalctl -u zthfs --no-pager -n 10

# Fix: Update systemd service to disable restrictive security settings
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/zthfs.service

# Ensure the service runs as root and disables namespace restrictions:
[Service]
User=root
NoNewPrivileges=no
PrivateTmp=no
PrivateDevices=no
ProtectHome=no
ProtectSystem=no
ProtectKernelTunables=no
ProtectKernelModules=no
ProtectControlGroups=no

# Reload and restart
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart zthfs
```

**Cause**: systemd's security features create isolated namespaces that prevent FUSE from accessing system resources.

#### 6. Access Denied After Mount (Permission Configuration Issues)

If filesystem mounts successfully but access is denied:

```bash
# Check if filesystem is mounted
mount | grep zthfs

# Check your user ID and group ID
id

# Update configuration to include your user/group
sudo vim /etc/zthfs/config.json

# Add your UID and GID to allowed lists:
{
  "security": {
    "allowed_users": [0, 1000],  // Add your UID
    "allowed_groups": [0, 1000]  // Add your GID
  }
}

# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart zthfs
```

**Cause**: ZTHFS implements strict access control. Only users and groups explicitly listed in the configuration can access the filesystem.

#### 7. SELinux or Security Policy Conflicts

If you suspect SELinux or other security policies are interfering:

```bash
# Check SELinux status
sestatus

# Check file contexts
ls -Z /mnt/zthfs/

# Temporarily disable SELinux for testing (not recommended for production)
sudo setenforce 0

# If SELinux is the issue, create appropriate policy or run in permissive mode
sudo semodule -i zthfs.pp  # If you have a custom policy
```

**Cause**: Security policies may prevent FUSE operations or filesystem access even when properly configured.

#### 3. Performance Issues

```bash
# Enable performance monitoring
zthfs health --metrics --verbose

# Optimize configuration
zthfs validate --config /etc/zthfs/config.json

# Check system resources
htop
```

#### 4. Log Issues

```bash
# Check log file permissions
ls -l /var/log/zthfs/

# Fix log directory permissions
sudo chown -R zthfs:zthfs /var/log/zthfs

# Manually rotate logs
zthfs log --rotate
```

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Enable debug logs
export RUST_LOG=debug
zthfs mount --verbose

# View detailed error messages
journalctl -u zthfs -f

# Core dump
ulimit -c unlimited
gdb zthfs core
```

### Performance Tuning

```bash
# Adjust cache size
vim /etc/zthfs/config.json
# Modify performance.cache_size

# Adjust concurrent limits
vim /etc/zthfs/config.json
# Modify performance.max_concurrent_operations

# Restart service to apply configuration
zthfs restart
```
