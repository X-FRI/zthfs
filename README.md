## Configuration Management

### Configuration File Structure

ZTHFS uses JSON configuration files, supporting hot reloading:

```json
{
  "data_dir": "/var/lib/zthfs/data",
  "mount_point": "/mnt/medical",
  "encryption": {
    "key": "hex-encoded-32-byte-key-here",
    "nonce_seed": "hex-encoded-12-byte-seed"
  },
  "logging": {
    "enabled": true,
    "file_path": "/var/log/zthfs/access.log",
    "level": "info",
    "max_size": 1048576,
    "rotation_count": 5
  },
  "integrity": {
    "enabled": true,
    "xattr_namespace": "zthfs.checksum"
  },
  "performance": {
    "max_concurrent_operations": 100,
    "cache_size": 1000,
    "chunk_size": 4194304
  },
  "security": {
    "allowed_users": [1000],
    "allowed_groups": [1000],
    "max_failed_attempts": 5,
    "lockout_duration": 300
  }
}
```

### Configuration Validation

```bash
# Validate configuration file
zthfs validate --config /etc/zthfs/config.json

# Generate default configuration
zthfs init --config /etc/zthfs/config.json
```

### Chunking Configuration

ZTHFS supports configurable file chunking to optimize performance for different workloads:

```json
{
  "performance": {
    "chunk_size": 4194304,    // 4MB (default), set to 0 to disable chunking
    "max_concurrent_operations": 100,
    "cache_size": 1000
  }
}
```

Chunk Size Options:
- `0`: Disable chunking entirely (all files stored as single files)
- `1024*1024` (1MB): Smaller chunks, better for random access
- `4*1024*1024` (4MB): Default balance between memory usage and performance
- `16*1024*1024` (16MB): Larger chunks, better for sequential access

When to Adjust Chunk Size:
- Small chunks (< 2MB): Better for systems with frequent random access patterns
- Large chunks (≥ 8MB): Better for streaming workloads and memory-constrained environments
- Disable chunking (0): For workloads where all files are small or performance is critical

### Environment Variable Configuration

```bash
export ZTHFS_DATA_DIR=/data/zthfs
export ZTHFS_MOUNT_POINT=/mnt/medical
export ZTHFS_LOG_LEVEL=debug
zthfs mount
```

## Usage Guide

### Command Line Tool

```bash
# Mount filesystem
zthfs mount --data-dir /data --mount-point /mnt/medical

# Unmount filesystem
zthfs unmount /mnt/medical

# Health check
zthfs health

# System info
zthfs info

# Validate configuration
zthfs validate --config /etc/zthfs/config.json
```

### Programmatic Usage

```rust
use zthfs::{config::FilesystemConfigBuilder, fs_impl::Zthfs};

// Load configuration
let config = FilesystemConfig::from_file("/etc/zthfs/config.json")?;

// Create filesystem instance

// Mount filesystem
fuser::mount2(
    filesystem,
    &config.mount_point,
    &[
        fuser::MountOption::FSName("zthfs".to_string()),
        fuser::MountOption::AutoUnmount,
        fuser::MountOption::AllowOther,
    ]
)?;
```

### Monitoring and Logging

```bash
# View real-time logs
tail -f /var/log/zthfs/access.log

- Dependencies: tokio (1.0), crossbeam-channel (0.5), blake3 (1.8.2), criterion (0.7.0)

### Performance Optimization Insights

#### Chunking Strategy Benefits:
- Memory Efficiency: Large files (>4MB) use 75% less peak memory through chunked processing
- Metadata Advantage: Chunked files provide ~50% faster size queries via metadata lookup
- Scalability: Supports files of any size without memory constraints

#### Performance Trade-offs:
- Security Enhancement: BLAKE3 nonce generation provides cryptographic security (48% encryption overhead acceptable)
- Async Logging: Channel-based architecture eliminates lock contention in high-concurrency scenarios
- Partial Writes: POSIX-compliant write semantics with reasonable performance overhead
- Permission Checks: Fine-grained access control with minimal latency impact
- Compiler Optimizations: LTO and CPU-specific instructions maximize performance within security constraints

#### Recommended Usage Patterns:
- Small Files (<4MB): Optimal for frequent random access operations
- Large Files (≥4MB): Better for sequential access and memory-constrained environments
- Medical Imaging: Chunking ideal for large DICOM files with sequential processing
- Concurrent Access: Excellent performance under multi-user medical workflows

### Chunking Performance Trade-offs Analysis

#### 1. When Should Chunking Be Enabled?

Enable chunking when you have:
- Large file workloads: Systems processing files >4MB (DICOM images, large datasets)
- Memory-constrained environments: Edge devices, embedded systems, or limited RAM
- Sequential access patterns: Applications that read entire files or large contiguous blocks
- Scalability requirements: Systems handling files of unpredictable or very large sizes

Avoid chunking when you have:
- Small file dominance: Most files <1MB with frequent random access
- Real-time requirements: Applications needing sub-millisecond response times
- Predictable file sizes: Workloads where most files fall near the chunking threshold (3-5MB)
- High random access frequency: Systems requiring frequent small reads from large files

#### 2. How to Choose Chunk Size?

Chunk Size Selection Guidelines:

| Chunk Size    | Use Case                                 | Performance Characteristics                           |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1MB           | High random access, real-time systems    | Lower memory usage, more frequent I/O operations      |
| 4MB (Default) | Balanced workloads, general medical data | Optimal balance of memory efficiency and access speed |
| 8-16MB        | Sequential access, streaming workloads   | Maximum memory efficiency, fewer I/O operations       |
| 0 (Disabled)  | Small files only, maximum performance    | No chunking overhead, direct file access              |

Selection Criteria:
- Smaller chunks (1-2MB): Choose when random access is frequent and memory is not a bottleneck
- Medium chunks (4MB): Default choice for mixed workloads and general medical applications
- Larger chunks (8-16MB): Choose when memory efficiency is critical and sequential access dominates
- Disabled (0): Choose only when all files are small and performance is paramount

#### 3. Performance Impact of Chunking

Performance Trade-offs:

| Operation Type   | Small Files (<4MB)        | Large Files (≥4MB)    | Impact                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Memory Usage     | Standard                  | 75% reduction         | ✅ Significant benefit |
| Sequential Read  | Good                      | Excellent             | ✅ Major improvement   |
| Random Access    | Excellent                 | 93% penalty           | ⚠️ Severe degradation  |
| File Size Query  | Slower (decrypt required) | 49% faster (metadata) | ✅ Net benefit         |
| Write Operations | Standard                  | Slight overhead       | ⚠️ Minor impact        |

## Performance Tuning

### Benchmark Configuration

ZTHFS v2.0 uses advanced compiler profiles optimized for high-concurrency and large file operations:

```toml
[profile.release]
opt-level = 3        # enable highest level of optimization
lto = true           # enable link time optimization
codegen-units = 1    # use single code generation unit, for better optimization
panic = "abort"      # abort on panic, reduce binary size
strip = true         # remove debug symbols, further reduce binary size
debug = true         # keep debug information for production environment troubleshooting

[profile.bench]
inherits = "release" # inherit release configuration
debug = false        # remove debug information to get accurate benchmark results

```

#### Configuration Options Explained

| Option                 | Purpose                                         | Impact on Performance              |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `opt-level = 3`        | Enables maximum compiler optimizations          | +10-15% performance improvement    |
| `debug = false`        | Removes debug symbols and metadata              | +2-5% reduced binary size          |
| `lto = true`           | Link-time optimization across crate boundaries  | +5-10% better code generation      |
| `codegen-units = 1`    | Single compilation unit for better optimization | +3-8% improved instruction cache   |
| `panic = "abort"`      | Minimal panic runtime overhead                  | +1-2% faster error paths           |
| `strip = true`         | Removes all debug symbols                       | +1-3% reduced binary size          |
| `inherits = "release"` | Inherit release profile settings                | Consistent optimization levels     |
| RUSTFLAGS              | Environment variable for CPU-specific opts      | +5-10% architecture-specific gains |

### Performance Tuning Recommendations

zthfs health --metrics --verbose
```

### Benchmark Accuracy Notes

- Baseline Measurements: All benchmarks use statistical analysis with 95% confidence intervals
- Outlier Detection: Criterion.rs automatically detects and handles measurement outliers
- Warm-up Period: Each benchmark includes a 3-second warm-up phase
- Sample Size: 100 samples per benchmark for statistical reliability
- CPU Frequency Impact: Performance results are sensitive to CPU frequency scaling - higher frequencies yield better results
- Hardware Acceleration: AES-NI and CRC32c hardware acceleration significantly improve cryptographic operations

### CPU Frequency Impact Analysis

The benchmark results show significant performance improvements with optimized compiler settings and CPU-specific optimizations:

| Component        | Metric                | Performance Improvement |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Encryption       | 1KB AES-256-GCM       | -32.5% latency          |
| Encryption       | 1MB AES-256-GCM       | -30.2% latency          |
| File I/O         | 1KB operations        | -8.0% latency           |
| File I/O         | 1MB operations        | -20.9% latency          |
| Chunking         | 8MB file operations   | -41.4% latency          |
| Nonce Generation | Per-file unique nonce | +3.8% latency           |
